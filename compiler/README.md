# Aurora compiler

Aurora is an intentionally incompatible safe C++-inspired language. It has no
C header/macro layer, raw-pointer escape, unsafe block or C ABI. The hosted build
uses an Aurora-written [lexer](LEXER.md) bootstrapped from a C++ seed; parsing,
semantic/lifetime analysis, typed-IR verification and x86-64 emission remain C++23.
GNU assembler/linker and Linux host I/O remain bootstrap dependencies.

## Build and check

```sh
make -C compiler
build/aurorac --module-root library examples/core_math.au -o build/core_math.s
build/aurorac --check --diagnostics=json examples/core_math.au --module-root library
make -C compiler test
```

Compiler-only testing uses the canonical Meson graph and is not root `full`.
[Development and qualification](../docs/developer-test-contract.md) defines exact
routes, selected-artifact identity, explicit pinned compatibility and merge gates.
The optional [language server](lsp/README.md) has its own dependency and suite.

## Supported source

- A file starts with `module name;` or `export module name;`; direct named imports
  use explicit `--module-root` directories. Namespaces and exports never bypass
  private members or defining-module lookup.
- Functions use `auto name(Type parameter) -> Result`; locals use an explicit
  type, mandatory initializer and optional `const`. Local `auto` deduction is absent.
- Types include i64/u64/u8/bool, closed nominal enums, inline classes, fixed
  arrays and the separately checked ownership/view/service modes below.
- Blocks, exact-bool `if`/`else`, `while`, return and restricted `static_assert`
  work. No `for`, `break` or `continue`; a loop conservatively may run zero times.
  Every continuing function path must return, and unreachable statements reject.
- Arithmetic, conversions and indexing are checked. Operands and arguments
  evaluate left-to-right. Array stores check their index before evaluating RHS.
  Constructor arguments snapshot left-to-right, then fields initialize in
  declaration order. Checked failure is fail-stop, with no exception unwinding.
- Decimal/binary integers, ASCII byte literals, exact-length byte-string array
  initializers and synchronous readonly literal arguments have exact scalar/byte
  rules. Comments use `//`; legacy `fn`/`let` and conventional C declarations reject.

These are bounded mechanisms. General ownership/lifetime polymorphism,
concurrency/effects, arbitrary destructors, rich type algebra/reflection,
optimizer, separate binary compilation, complete runtime and self-hosting remain
open. Safety tests are not a proof of Rust equivalence or production readiness.

## Owned scalar safety and const

```text
own<i64> seed = own(40);
{
    mutref<i64> edit = borrow_mut(seed);
    write(edit, read(edit) + 2);
}
const own<i64> answer = move(seed);
```

`own<i64>` is an affine stack-resident scalar capability, not a heap allocation or a general resource implementation. `own(value)` initializes it; `move(name)` transfers its value and invalidates the old binding. Owners never support reassignment, even without `const`; unused owners may be dropped. Implicit owner copies are rejected.

`borrow(owner)` creates a shared reference. `borrow_mut(owner)` creates an exclusive reference and requires a non-const owner. Multiple shared references may coexist; shared/exclusive borrows cannot overlap. A borrowed owner cannot move, and an exclusively borrowed owner cannot be read through its original binding. `read` copies a scalar value through an owner/reference; `write` changes it through a non-const mutable-reference binding and returns the written value.

Const is deliberately stronger than shallow C++ smart-pointer constness: a const owner cannot be mutably borrowed, nor moved into a mutable owner. Moving it to another const owner is permitted. A `const mutref<i64>` binding cannot write through that binding. This does not provide arbitrary casts, type assertions or a way to remove constness.

Borrow lifetimes end at the declaring block's end, not at inferred last use. References cannot be returned, passed to functions, copied, rebound, placed in aggregates, or borrowed again. They target already-declared scalar owners only. At conditional joins an owner is unavailable if any continuing path moved it; return-only paths do not constrain later code. Unsupported reference escape and aggregate borrowing fail closed.

## Precise while-loop ownership rule

The compiler records incoming owner-liveness and borrow state before the condition. It checks the condition and body once under that state. Each continuing backedge must preserve every incoming local's owner-liveness and borrow counts; moving an outer owner on any continuing path is rejected, even if the condition is a constant or appears to permit just one iteration. Moves on paths that definitely return are permitted because those paths never take the backedge.

Body-local owners may be created, moved and dropped on each iteration. Body-local borrows expire at the iteration block's end. Existing outer references can be read/written according to their capability. Since the condition can initially be false, exit state restores incoming ownership facts; scalar/aggregate value mutations remain real runtime effects. Nested loops obey the same rule. There is no claimed general fixed-point lifetime solver, loop escape reference model or `break`/`continue` behavior yet.

## Working reflection

`size_of(Type)`, `type_id(Type)` and `field_count(Type)` are compile-time queries. `static_assert(bool_expression)` accepts literals, these queries, comparisons, logical negation, and exact-bool `&&`/`||` composition; general arithmetic constant evaluation and code generation remain deferred.

Builtin type IDs: i64=1, bool=2, own<i64>=3, ref<i64>=4, mutref<i64>=5. U64 has ID8 and size8; U8 has ID11 and size1; existing builtin sizes are 8,1,8,8,8. Scalar bool's logical size is one byte, but its current stack slot is eight bytes. Class IDs begin at 100 in deterministic graph declaration order and are compilation-graph-local; defining-module/native names determine source type identity. Mentioned array types have IDs `1000000 + 2*N + B`, where B is one for bool and zero for i64. U64 array IDs use `2000000 + N`; U8 arrays use `3000000 + N`. Class IDs cannot collide with either array range.

`reflect_size(id)` and `reflect_field_count(id)` execute runtime lookups. Unknown IDs return zero. Descriptor entries are emitted for builtins, declared classes and array types used in storage/size/type-ID queries. Array size is `8*N`; arrays and builtins have zero named fields. Class field counts include public fields only, and class size includes all fields. Reflection cannot expose private values or bypass lifetime checks. Runtime queries use the defining module's visible descriptor view; unavailable/private IDs return zero, and reflection cannot implicitly import a type. Member traversal, invocation, mapped/conditional types and `keyof`-style type algebra remain design goals.

`--referenced-reflection-only` is an explicit closed-image output mode. It emits
only helpers directly referenced by runtime metadata queries in retained, validated
IR. Every source function, including unused imports, is still checked before
retention; queried helper bodies and scope visibility are unchanged. The default
keeps all existing external reflection symbols. Closed images must not rely on
handwritten/native calls to helpers that source queries do not retain. Only the
protected program-console supervisor currently opts in; other native profiles
and user-program outputs retain their existing default inventories.

## Temporary machine integration

The bootstrap assembly boundary currently passes six scalar arguments in RDI, RSI, RDX, RCX, R8, R9 and returns RAX. It preserves RBP, does not touch RBX/R12–R15, and aligns RSP to sixteen bytes immediately before calls. Scalar-only programs generate no red zone, libc, heap allocation, SIMD or runtime-library calls. Resource programs explicitly link the hosted byte adapter described in OWNERSHIP.md. Sealed service graphs use their separate checked service adapters and private source-symbol linkage without an owned-byte allocator dependency. External assembly callers must provide canonical zero/one bools and correct stack alignment.

These temporary register choices are implementation machinery, not a source-level C ABI or binary interoperability promise. Only scalar-signature unqualified root functions retain unmangled names for the temporary bootstrap assembly bridge. Imported/namespaced functions use length-prefixed Aurora-native symbols. The compiler emits a complete import graph with per-defining-module reflection helpers; separately linking overlapping compiled graphs is not supported yet. A versioned Aurora-native ABI remains to be designed.

`examples/kernel.au` performs a mutable borrow, releases it, moves ownership and returns 42. `examples/class_values.au` demonstrates class copies/visibility/reflection. `examples/loops_arrays.au` demonstrates checked traversal and independent arrays.

Runtime-sized [typed copied-class owners](OWNERSHIP.md#runtime-sized-copied-class-ownership)
now support the concrete `expression_arena.au` bootstrap AST storage consumer.
The expression parser remains C++; typed storage does not establish parser migration.
